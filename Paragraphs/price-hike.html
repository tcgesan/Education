          <h1>Price Hike</h1> <br> <br> 
          A price hike refers to the increase in the cost of goods and services over time. This can happen due to various reasons such as inflation, 
          supply chain disruptions, higher production costs, or increased demand. Price hikes often affect basic necessities like food, fuel, and medicine, 
          making it difficult for people, especially those with low incomes, to afford everyday items. <br> <br>

          One major cause of price hikes is inflation, where the overall value of money decreases, and it takes more money to buy the same goods. 
          In many countries, price hikes are linked to rising fuel prices, as transportation costs for goods increase. Natural disasters, political instability, 
          or war can also disrupt supply chains, leading to shortages and price increases. <br> <br>
          
          Price hikes can have a negative impact on the economy. When the cost of living rises, people’s purchasing power decreases, 
          leading to reduced consumption. This can affect businesses, especially small ones, and lead to a slowdown in economic growth. 
          However, some price increases may also be necessary to cover rising production costs or to promote a stable economy.
          To manage price hikes, governments often take steps like controlling inflation, providing subsidies, or promoting policies that 
          encourage competition. Awareness and careful budgeting are also important for individuals to cope with rising prices.
