          <h1>Early Marriage </h1> <br> <br> 
          Early marriage refers to when children, especially girls, are married before reaching adulthood, typically before the age of 18. 
          It is a common practice in many parts of the world, including Bangladesh, and often results from cultural traditions, poverty, 
          and lack of education. While some believe early marriage can provide financial stability or preserve family honor, it can have 
          harmful effects on the health and future of young girls. <br> <br>

          One of the biggest problems with early marriage is that it can end a girl’s education. When girls marry young, they often have to stop going to school, 
          which limits their opportunities for a better life. Early marriage also leads to early pregnancies, which can be risky for both the mother and the child. 
          Young girls are more likely to experience complications during childbirth, and their children are more likely to be born underweight or face health issues. <br> <br>
          
          Furthermore, early marriage often limits a girl’s freedom and choices. She may not be emotionally or physically ready for the 
          responsibilities of marriage and motherhood, which can lead to stress, violence, and a lack of independence. To stop early marriage, communities must raise
           awareness about its dangers, promote education for girls, and enforce laws that protect young people from this practice.
