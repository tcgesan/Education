          <h1>Climate Change </h1> <br> <br> 
       <p> Climate change refers to the long-term changes in Earth's temperature, weather patterns, and climate
         systems. It happens mainly because of human activities, such as burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, and gas),
          deforestation, and industrial processes. These activities release greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide (CO2),
           into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat from the sun, making the Earth warmer – a process called global warming. <br> <br>

        The effects of climate change are becoming more visible every year. Temperatures are rising, causing ice caps and glaciers to melt. 
        This leads to higher sea levels, which threaten coastal areas with flooding. Extreme weather events like storms, droughts, and heatwaves are 
        becoming more frequent and severe. Additionally, it disrupts ecosystems, endangering many animal and plant species.
        
        Climate change affects people, too. Farmers struggle with unpredictable weather, leading to food shortages. Heatwaves and air
         pollution harm human health. However, we can slow climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Using renewable energy 
         like solar and wind power, planting trees, and conserving energy are effective steps. <br>
        
        Fighting climate change requires global cooperation, as it impacts everyone. By acting responsibly, we can protect our planet for future generations. </p>
