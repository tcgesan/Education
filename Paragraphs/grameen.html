          <h1>Grameen Bank</h1> <br> <br> 
          Grameen Bank is a famous microfinance institution in Bangladesh, founded by Nobel Peace Prize winner
           Dr. Muhammad Yunus in 1983. The main purpose of Grameen Bank is to help the poor, especially in rural 
           areas, by offering small loans known as microcredit. Traditional banks usually require collateral, which many 
           poor people do not have, so Grameen Bank created a new model that does not need collateral. This approach 
           makes it easier for people with limited resources to borrow money, start small businesses, and improve their living conditions. <br> <br> 

         One unique feature of Grameen Bank is its focus on empowering women, who make up the majority of its borrowers. 
         By providing women with financial support, the bank helps them contribute more to their families and gain independence. 
         The success of Grameen Bank has also inspired many similar programs worldwide, proving that microfinance can be a powerful 
         tool for reducing poverty. Today, Grameen Bank serves millions of people across Bangladesh, and it continues to play an important 
         role in promoting economic development and social change. Through its innovative model, Grameen Bank has shown that even small 
         loans can create big opportunities for people to improve their lives.
