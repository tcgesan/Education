          <h1> Covid-19 Pandamic and its Impact  </h1> <br> <br> 

          <p>

            The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the coronavirus, was one of the biggest global health crises in recent history. 
            It began in late 2019 in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread worldwide. The virus is highly contagious, spreading through
             coughs, sneezes, or close contact with infected individuals. Common symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing, 
             but it can be deadly, especially for older people or those with weak immune systems. <br> <br>

            To control the spread, countries implemented lockdowns, social distancing, and mask mandates. Schools, businesses, 
            and public places were closed, and many people had to stay at home. This disrupted daily life and affected the global 
            economy. Millions of people lost their jobs, and businesses suffered huge losses. Students had to adapt to online learning, 
            while healthcare systems struggled to handle the surge in patients. <br> <br>
            
            The pandemic also taught valuable lessons. It showed the importance of hygiene, wearing masks, and getting vaccinated. 
            Scientists developed vaccines in record time, which helped reduce the spread and severity of the virus.
            
            While COVID-19 caused immense suffering, it also brought people together to fight a common challenge. It reminded us 
            of the need to prioritize health and support one another during tough times.
